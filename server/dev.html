  This page is dedicated to all developers that would like to help us
  develop the service, create new tools or integrate it in the existing
  software.

<a name="API"></a>
<h2>API</h2>
<p>
  Open-Tran had an open API since its creation in February 2007.
  The interface is exported through
  the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com">XML-RPC</a> protocol.
  You can fetch the suggestions from the server using your
  own software by sending a request to the server and fetching an XML
  response with the results.  The following link will take you to 
  <a href="/RPC2">the documentation of all exported functions</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Below is the list of programming languages with code snippets (or
  links to such) that give an example of how to access the Open-Tran
  service with it.
</p>

<a name="Python"></a>
<h3>Python</h3>
<p>
  Below is an example of a very simple python script that searches for
  translations of the phrase "<em>save as</em>" from English to
  Brazilian Portugese.
</p>
    <pre>
      from xmlrpclib import ServerProxy

      lang = "pt_br" # replace with your language code
      server = ServerProxy("http://open-tran.eu/RPC2")
      for sugg in server.suggest("save as", lang):
          print sugg
    </pre>

<a name="C"></a>
<h3>C</h3>
<p>
  Ignacio Casal Quinteiro has contributed
  an <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=101873">example
    implementation in C</a>.
</p>

<a name="Offline"></a>
<h2>Off-line mode</h2>
<p>
  Since June, 2008 it is possible to use the Open-Tran service in an
  off-line mode.  Once the user downloads the databases, she may query
  it localy.  The off-line access has one important advantage: it
  returns the results almost instantly.
</p>

<a name="Installing"></a>
<h3>Installing</h3>
<p>
  First, go to our FTP site
  at <a href="ftp://open-tran.eu">ftp://open-tran.eu</a> and download
  two databases: an English one
  (currently: <a href="ftp://open-tran.eu/ten-en.db">ftp://open-tran.eu/ten-en.db</a>)
  and one for your language (for
  example: <a href="ftp://open-tran.eu/ten-pt_br.db">ftp://open-tran.eu/ten-pt_br.db</a>
  for Brazilian Portuguese).  The databases have to be stored (or
  symlinked) in the <tt>.open-tran</tt> directory in the user's home
  directory.
</p>
<p>
  You will also need to download the software
  from <a href="ftp://open-tran.eu/open-tran-latest.tar.gz">ftp://open-tran.eu/open-tran-latest.tar.gz</a>.
  Currently, there are two tools in the tarball:
</p>
<ol>
<li><tt>suggest.py</tt> is a console script that may be run like
  this: <tt>suggest.py "save as" es</tt></li>
<li><tt>open-tran.py</tt> is a GTK-based GUI tool that has never
  really been completed.  I thought that I would be able to create a
  po-editor within few hours but it turned out to be a wrong
  assumption :)</li> 
</ol>


<a name="Database"></a>
<h3>Database</h3>
<p>
  Open-Tran stores the phrases
  in <a href="http://sqlite.org">SQLite3</a> databases.  Below is the
  diagram depicting the current database schema.  You can find the SQL
  for it 
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/open-tran/source/browse/trunk/import/step2.sql?r=180">in
  the repository</a>.<br/>
  <img src="/images/db-ten.png" alt="database diagram" width="100%"/><br/>
  The field <tt>length</tt> in the table <tt>Phrases</tt> holds
  the number of words in the phrase and there is currently only
  one <tt>flag</tt>: value 1 indicates that the translation is fuzzy.
</p>


<a name="Algorithm"></a>
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<p>
  Open-Tran first tries to find the most similar phrase in the
  original language.  In order to do that, we compute the number of
  words that are not in the intersection of the phrases.  The lower
  the number, the better.  As an example consider the following
  situation: we are looking for the phrase <tt>"do you really want to
  save"</tt>.  Let's consider the following candidates:
  <table>
    <tr><th>candidate</th><th>score</th></tr>
    <tr><td>do you really want to <span class="yellow">quit</span></td><td>2 (quit, save)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>save <span class="yellow">what</span> you want</td><td>3 (what, do, really)</td>
  </table><br/>
  Once we find the best matches, we locate their translations via
  their <tt>locationid</tt>.
</p>
